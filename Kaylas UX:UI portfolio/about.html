      <p>Growing up with a single mom we didn't have much money and so I grew up on a tight budget.I didn't know I was being raised on limited resources because I was only a kid but, because we lacked the financial means to have a television or to buy expensive toys I had to get creative with sources of entertainment. I was taught to use my imagination which led me to being able to create a toy out of just about anything in our home. I was constantly creating games and toys I saw at friends homes out of odds and ends in my house. Of course I put my own spin and made these toys better then what I had seen because there are no limits when using your imagination. It was here my facenation with how things worked began. Thus began the journey to find a passion that satisified this curiosity.</p>
		  <br>
      <br>
      <p>It was in a random coincidence that I was introduced to the world of UX/UI Design. While working in sales after College I was a Lyfting to make connections in my career and I  picked up a passenger who radiated pure excitement and joy. She told me all about her career as a UX/UI designer. I had never even heard of this career and was so excited to hear every detail. As she went on, It took everything inside of me not to have her get out of my car so I could immediately go home and research this job. I held off from leaving her on the side of the road and took her to her final destination. But, it was then that I began my research. Turns out it seemed to be a perfect fit.</p>
			<br>
      <br>
      <p>So, I did the logical thing and jumped into the field headfirst. I quickly realized that UX/UI design allowed me to solve problems logically via research a skill I came to love while getting my degree in Psychology and use of my perfectionist personality coupled with the free spirit inside of me that is passionate about creating, design and art. I get to help people everyday by making things easier to use and in turn better and more exciting to use just like I did as a kid creating games and toys for myself. I get to help people have better lives all while utilizing all the best parts of myself. I love what I do and cant wait to join up with you to create some really awesome projects!</p>
